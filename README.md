## Research & CVEs

### Security Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices (2018-2020)

- **[Security Vulnerabilities in Meross MSS110](https://garrettmiller.github.io/meross-mss110-vuln/)**
  - **CVE-2018-6401**: [Details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6401) - *Meross MSS110 devices before 1.1.24 contain a TELNET listener providing access for an undocumented admin account with a blank password.*
  - **CVE-2018-6402**: [Details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6402) - *Ecobee Ecobee4 4.2.0.171 devices can be forced to deauthenticate and connect to an unencrypted Wi-Fi network with the same SSID, even if the device settings specify use of encryption such as WPA2, as long as the competing network has a stronger signal. An attacker must be able to set up a nearby SSID, similar to an "Evil Twin" attack.*
  - **CVE-2018-10544**: [Details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10544) - *Meross MSS110 devices through 1.1.24 contain an unauthenticated admin.htm administrative interface.*

### Deauth Star: Attacking Wireless Surveillance Devices (2015-2016)

- **A pair of vulnerabilities, which, when exploited, can lead to full compromise of a WPA2-PSK WLAN.**

  - **CVE-2016-5081**: [Details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5081) - *ZModo ZP-NE14-S and ZP-IBH-13W devices have a hardcoded root password, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a TELNET session.*
  - **CVE-2016-5650**: [Details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5650) - *ZModo ZP-NE14-S and ZP-IBH-13W devices do not enforce a WPA2 configuration setting, which allows remote attackers to trigger association with an arbitrary access point by using a recognized SSID value.*

### Future Implications of GPU Acceleration on Present Cryptographic Standards (2010-2011)

- **[Undergraduate Thesis](https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/372)**
  - Explored how then-novel GPU acceleration of cryptographic algorithms could impact current security and cryptographic standards.
